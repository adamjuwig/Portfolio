                  Hi, I'm Adam! I am a recent graduate of the Full Stack Coding
                  bootcamp through the University of Arizona. My journey in web
                  development started back in the days of Geocities and
                  Angelfire, where I was immediately drawn in by the concept of
                  making things and colors appear on screens by writing in code. I
                  am a former professional musician and currently a restaurant
                  general manager. Both, of which have taught me about business
                  management, client relations, problem solving, organization
                  and the importance of teamwork. I have strong interests in
                  front end technologies, UI/UX design, and am always looking
                  to develop new skills. In my free time, I enjoy cooking,
                  hiking, fishing, camping, geocaching and DIY projects.
